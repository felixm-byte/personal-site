Hi! I'm Felix - I'm a high-school student from the UK, and this is my space to share programming tutorials, hot takes and other discoveries and assorted curiosities. 

I'm mostly interested in programming, economics and urbanism (yes, I've played Cities Skylines and love it), but I'm interested in learning more about anything and everything.

If you want to share something interesting, or you'd like some help with anything, feel free to email me at hi@felix.ink.
